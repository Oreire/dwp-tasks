The Analysis of the Case Study Presented

Project Case Study

## Design a Cloud Architecture to host a 3-Tier Application

DWP has adopted a cloud-first strategy. You are tasked with designing a cloud architecture to host a 3-tier application (Presentation, Application, Data) that we are developing. The solution should be scalable, available and secure.
 
Produce a single architecture diagram illustrating how you would implement this in AWS or Azure. Your diagram should consider:

•         The components and services for each tier

•         Strategies for high availability and scalability

•         Security considerations and access control

•         Any additional services/tools for monitoring, logging & management

•         Your submission will be used as a discussion topic at your interview.
